//1. Create two variables, assign them numeric values, and print their multiplication result.
let number1 = 5 
let number2 = 6 
let result = number1 * number2

// 2. Create a variable to store your age and print a message using template literals that includes your age.
let firstName = "Bryant"
let lastName = "Facenda"
let age = 22 
console.log(`Hi, my name is ${firstName} ${lastName} and i am ${age} years old`)

//3. Create three boolean variables and use logical operators to print the result of, at least, two different conditions.
let iamHunger = true
let iamGoing = false
let iWantCoffee = false
let result1 = iamHunger && iamGoing
let result2 = iamHunger || iamGoing
let result3 = !iWantCoffee
console.log(result1)

//4. Create a little script that initialize a numeric variable, then increment it by 1, and finally, compare it with the value of pi (3.14).
let x = 4
